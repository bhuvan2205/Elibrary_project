        <p>Exploiting, or taking advantage of a (formerly identified) vulnerability,
allows you to gain control of a remote machine (or device). This access can then be used
for further privilege escalation attacks, either locally on the compromised machine, or on
other machines accessible on its local network. This category contains a number of tools
and utilities that simplify the process of writing your own exploits.</p>
<p>When the technical side is well-secured, 
there is often the possibility of exploiting human behavior as an attack vector.
 Given the right influence, people
can frequently be induced to take actions that compromise the security of the environment.
Did the USB key that the secretary just plugged in contain a harmless PDF? Or was it also a
Trojan horse that installed a backdoor?
This category contains tools that aid in these types of attacks.</p>
<p>Collecting data about the target network and its structure,
 identifying computers, their operating systems, 
 and the services that they run.
  Identifying potentially sensitive parts of the information system. 
 Extracting all sorts of listings from running
directory services.
